# Imbalanced Learning
 Designing an efficient credit card fraud detector trained on anonymized credit card transactions

This report describes my research project in the course Statistical Computing in R & Python at Texas A&M University in which I took up a challenging topic of studying a classification problem wherein the data set chosen is highly imbalanced.  Through this project, I have made a humble effort in understanding an unbalanced dataset, transforming it into a form that can be utilized for classification and deriving valuable insights from it. However, the primary aim of this project would be to try different linear and non- linear classification algorithms to detect a fraudulent credit card transaction. The input data set contains anonymized credit card transaction details of different individuals. The dataset is labelled with input features and an output variable which takes binary values representing the two classes - honest transaction and a malicious transaction. We also performed tuning of hyperparameters for each of the models. Eventually the project is focused on finding a ML model that could accurately predict fraudulent transactions which in turn would aid authorities/ institutions in keeping a check on suspicious banking activities. 


STEPS involved in running the code:

1) Obtain the dataset from the following link- https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
2) Download the .ipynb file from the repository
3) Open the file in Jupyter Notebook
4) Provide the path to the .csv file (dataset) in the beginning of the code.
